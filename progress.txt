## Codebase Patterns
- Use TypeScript enums with string values for database column values (e.g., Tier.HOT = "HOT")
- Use ISO 8601 date strings for all timestamp fields
- Use JSDoc comments on interfaces and enums to document purpose and half-lives
- JSON arrays stored as strings in SQLite (e.g., use_days)

- Use better-sqlite3 for synchronous SQLite operations with TypeScript
- Enable WAL mode (journal_mode = WAL) for concurrency
- Use INTEGER for boolean columns (do_not_inject, pinned) with 0/1 values
- Foreign key constraints supported but need PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON for enforcement

## 2026-01-31 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created SQLite database wrapper with full schema initialization
- Files changed:
  - extensions/memory-tiered/db/sqlite.ts (new)
  - extensions/memory-tiered/package.json (added better-sqlite3)
  - extensions/memory-tiered/package-lock.json (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - better-sqlite3 requires native compilation; works best with Node.js 18+
  - SQLite CHECK constraints enforce tier values at DB level: CHECK (tier IN ('HOT', 'WARM', 'COLD', 'ARCHIVE'))
  - Schema includes nullable columns entity_refs and meta_type for Phase 2 extensions
  - The Database class initializes schema in constructor - call once per db path
  - WAL mode provides better concurrency for read-heavy workloads

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
- What was implemented: Created core/types.ts with all type definitions for the tiered memory system
- Files changed:
  - extensions/memory-tiered/core/types.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses TypeScript with strict mode and NodeNext module resolution
  - Tier enum values should match the CHECK constraint in the future SQLite schema
  - MemoryType affects decay half-life: procedural (180d), factual (90d), project (45d), episodic (10d)
  - use_days is a string[] (JSON array) stored as string in SQLite for tracking distinct access days
