## Codebase Patterns
- Plugin directory structure: extensions/<plugin-name>/ with package.json, index.ts, tsconfig.json
- All source files use ESM modules (type: "module" in package.json)
- OpenClaw plugin registration: set openclaw.extensions array in package.json
- TypeScript config: ES2022 target with NodeNext module resolution

## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- What was implemented: Created plugin directory structure and scaffolding
- Files changed:
  - extensions/memory-tiered/package.json (new - plugin manifest)
  - extensions/memory-tiered/index.ts (new - entry point)
  - extensions/memory-tiered/tsconfig.json (new - TypeScript config)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The plugin uses @openclaw/memory-tiered as its package name
  - Entry point is index.ts which compiles to index.js (main field)
  - OpenClaw extensions registration uses the openclaw.extensions field in package.json
  - TypeScript is a dev dependency only - runtime uses compiled JS
